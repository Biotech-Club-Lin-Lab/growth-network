## Setting up the Environment

To recreate the exact environment used for this project, follow these steps:

1.  **Make sure you have Conda installed.** If not, you can install it from [Anaconda Distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) or [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).

2.  **Navigate to the project directory** in your terminal or Anaconda Prompt.

3.  **Create the Conda environment** from the `environment.yml` file:

    ```bash
    conda env create -f env.yml
    ```

    This command will create a new Conda environment with all the dependencies listed in the `env.yml` file.

4.  **Activate the newly created environment:**

    ```bash
    conda activate biotech
    ```
